# Getting Started

The _Deveel Repository_ is a framework that provides a set of abstractions and implementations of the [_Repository Pattern_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_pattern), to simplify the access to data sources in your application while keeping your domain model decoupled from any specific persistence technology.

Below you will find a quick and generic guide to start using the framework in your application.

To learn about the specific usage of the framework, you can read the following documentation:

| Topic | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [_Using the Entity Framework Core Repository_](repository-implementations/ef-core.md) | Learn how to use the Repository pattern with [Entity Framework Core](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore) |
| [_Using the MongoDB Repository_](repository-implementations/mongodb.md) | Accessing [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) databases through the Repository pattern |
| [_Using the In-Memory Repository_](repository-implementations/in-memory.md) | Interface a volatile and in-process storage using a Repository pattern. |
| [_The Entity Manager_](entity-manager/) | Provide your application with a business layer on top of the Repository for additional functions (_logging_, _validation_, _caching_, _event sourcing_, etc.) |
| [_Extending the Repository_](custom-repository.md) | Learn how to create a custom repository to access your data source, according to your specific data logic |
| [_Multi-Tenancy_](multi-tenancy.md) | Learn how to use the framework in a multi-tenant application |
| [_User Entities_](user-entities.md) | Learn how to define and query entities that are scoped to a specific user |

## Installation

The framework is organized into a _kernel_ package (`Deveel.Repository.Core`) that provides the basic interfaces and abstractions, and a set of _driver_ packages that implement those abstractions for specific data sources.

When you install any driver package, the kernel package is automatically pulled in as a transitive dependency — you do not need to install it explicitly.

### Requirements

The library targets the following .NET runtimes:

| .NET Runtime | Supported |
| ------------ | :-------: |
| .NET 8.0     | ✅ |
| .NET 9.0     | ✅ |
| .NET 10.0    | ✅ |

> Support for .NET 6.0 and .NET 7.0 was dropped. Please ensure your project targets .NET 8.0 or later.

### The Kernel Package

All driver packages are built on top of the _kernel_ package that provides the core interfaces and abstractions. If you want to develop your own driver for a specific data source, depend only on `Deveel.Repository.Core` and implement the `IRepository<TEntity>` interface.

```bash
dotnet add package Deveel.Repository.Core
```

### The Drivers

| Driver | Package | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| [_In-Memory_](repository-implementations/in-memory.md) | `Deveel.Repository.InMemory` | A volatile, in-process repository — ideal for testing and prototyping. |
| [_MongoDB_](repository-implementations/mongodb.md) | `Deveel.Repository.MongoFramework` | Stores entities in a MongoDB database via [MongoFramework](https://github.com/turnersoftware/mongoframework). |
| [_Entity Framework Core_](repository-implementations/ef-core.md) | `Deveel.Repository.EntityFramework` | Stores entities in any relational database supported by [Entity Framework Core](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore). |

## Instrumentation

The library provides extension methods on `IServiceCollection` to register repositories in the dependency injection container.

Use `AddRepository<TRepository>` to register a concrete repository type. The method uses reflection to discover all `IRepository<TEntity>` interface implementations on the given type and registers them automatically.

```csharp
// Program.cs
builder.Services.AddRepository<InMemoryRepository<MyEntity>>();
```

For custom repositories:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddRepository<MyCustomRepository>();
```

### Consuming the Repository

After calling `AddRepository<TRepository>`, the following service types become available in the DI container (availability depends on which interfaces the concrete repository implements):

| Service | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `MyCustomRepository` | The concrete repository implementation. |
| `IRepository<MyEntity>` | Core CRUD and key-based look-up. |
| `IMyCustomRepository` | The custom interface (if defined) that extends `IRepository<MyEntity>`. |
| `IQueryableRepository<MyEntity>` | LINQ-based queries (if implemented). |
| `IPageableRepository<MyEntity>` | Paginated queries (if implemented). |
| `IFilterableRepository<MyEntity>` | Filter-expression–based queries (if implemented). |
| `ITrackingRepository<MyEntity>` | Change-tracking queries (if implemented). |
