## Success Metrics

Each milestone release is considered successful when:

- All public APIs carry 100% XML documentation coverage — enforced in CI
- Test coverage ≥ 85% on Core and Manager packages
- No performance regressions vs. the previous milestone BenchmarkDotNet baseline
- A migration guide is published before the release NuGet packages land
- Zero P1 bug reports within 30 days of release
