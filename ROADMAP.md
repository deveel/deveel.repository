# Deveel Repository — Product Roadmap

**Current Version:** 1.4.3  
**Roadmap Horizon:** v1.5.0 → v2.0.0  
**Target Runtimes:** .NET 8.0, 9.0, 10.0  
**Last Updated:** April 27, 2026

---

## Overview

The Deveel Repository framework provides a pragmatic, DDD-aligned abstraction for multi-source data access in .NET. At v1.4.3 the framework delivers solid CRUD interfaces, a composable `QueryBuilder`, multi-driver support (EF Core, MongoDB, In-Memory, DynamicLinq), and an `EntityManager` that layers validation and caching on top.

The roadmap below takes the framework from *useful primitives* to a *complete developer toolkit*: sharper setup ergonomics, richer entity lifecycle management, first-class observability, and new database drivers — all while preserving the pragmatic, low-ambition philosophy of the project.

## Milestone 1: v1.5.0 — "Solid Ground"

**Release Target:** Q2 2026  
**Theme:** Correctness, coherence, and runtime modernization

The framework is in production use, but carries visible rough edges: a misspelled package folder, thread-safety gaps in the in-memory driver, unoptimized expression compilation, and patchy XML documentation. v1.5.0 eliminates friction that slows adoption and erodes confidence — making every existing feature work exactly as documented, on .NET 8, 9, and 10.

---

### Feature 1.5.1 — Package Namespace Correction

**Title:** Rename `Deveel.Repsotiory.MongoFramework` to `Deveel.Repository.MongoFramework`

**Intent**  
> "Remove a visible typo that undermines confidence in the framework's quality and makes the MongoDB package harder to find on disk and in NuGet."

**The Problem Today**  
The MongoDB driver package lives in a source folder spelled `Deveel.Repsotiory.MongoFramework` — a transposition error that propagates into the solution file, CI scripts, and developer tooling. Contributors navigating the source tree must mentally correct the spelling; consumers upgrading packages see an inconsistent name in their dependency graph.

**What We Are Building**  
- Rename the source folder, project file, and NuGet package from `Repsotiory` to `Repository`
- Publish a NuGet deprecation notice on the old package identifier that redirects to the corrected one
- Update all solution references, CI/CD pipelines, and documentation links accordingly
- Provide a one-line migration note in the changelog (package rename only, no API or namespace change)

**Benefits**
- Professional, consistent package naming across the entire framework
- Reduced contributor confusion when browsing the codebase or searching NuGet
- Correct discoverability for the package and its documentation
- Sets a clean baseline before the v2.0 breaking-change window

---

### Feature 1.5.2 — Thread-Safe In-Memory Repository

**Title:** Concurrent-Access Safety for In-Memory Storage

**Intent**  
> "Make the in-memory driver a trustworthy drop-in for integration tests and local development, regardless of how many threads are accessing it simultaneously."

**The Problem Today**  
`InMemoryRepository<TEntity, TKey>` uses an unguarded field-mapping cache when resolving entity properties. When multiple test threads or hosted-service tasks run concurrently against the same in-memory instance, race conditions can produce null-reference exceptions, cached-state corruption, or silent data loss — failures that are sporadic and notoriously hard to reproduce.

**What We Are Building**  
- Wrap the field-mapping cache with a `ReaderWriterLockSlim` or `Lazy<T>` guard
- Add a comprehensive concurrency test battery (100+ simultaneous readers and writers) to lock in the guarantee
- Document the thread-safety contract on the class and its core public methods
- Benchmark single-thread vs. multi-thread access to verify no regression on the happy-path speed

**Benefits**
- Reliable in-memory driver for any concurrency model: parallel test runners, background services, benchmarks
- Eliminates the sporadically-failing integration test that can affect consumer CI pipelines
- Documents the exact thread-safety contract consumers can rely on
- Builds confidence that switching from In-Memory to a real driver in production is functionally equivalent

---

### Feature 1.5.3 — Expression Compilation Cache

**Title:** Cached Compilation of Filter Expressions in the DynamicLinq Driver

**Intent**  
> "Avoid paying the expression-compilation cost more than once for the same filter, so high-frequency query paths stay fast under real workloads."

**The Problem Today**  
The DynamicLinq driver recompiles filter expressions on every query invocation. In production applications — particularly multi-tenant products where the same filter shape runs thousands of times per minute — this creates avoidable CPU overhead that surfaces as elevated p95 latencies during traffic spikes. An `IFilterCache` interface already exists but has no eviction policy, no size limit, and no statistics.

**What We Are Building**  
- A bounded, thread-safe expression cache keyed on the normalized filter expression string
- Cache eviction policy (LRU by default) with a configurable maximum entry count
- An `IFilterCacheStatistics` service that exposes hit/miss counters and current size for monitoring
- `IFilterCache` exposed as a replaceable DI service for consumers needing custom eviction logic
- BenchmarkDotNet baselines quantifying the speedup between warm-cache and cold-cache scenarios

**Benefits**
- Measurably lower CPU utilization for repetitive query patterns without any code change in consumer applications
- A tunable cache that consumers can size to their workload
- Observable behavior — cache statistics are ready to be scraped by monitoring dashboards
- No behavioral change for query results; only compilation is cached, not result sets

---

### Feature 1.5.4 — Full .NET 10 Compatibility and Benchmark Baseline

**Title:** .NET 10 Runtime Validation with Per-Target Performance Baselines

**Intent**  
> "Allow teams already on .NET 10 to adopt Deveel Repository without surprises, and give everyone a reliable benchmark record for detecting future regressions."

**The Problem Today**  
The framework lists .NET 10 as a target framework but has not been thoroughly validated — the CI matrix does not cover it end-to-end, and no benchmarks quantify what the new runtime's LINQ optimization gains mean in practice. Teams adopting .NET 10 hit undiscovered edge cases and miss out on runtime improvements that require nothing more than an updated dependency.

**What We Are Building**  
- .NET 10.0 added to the CI build and test matrix alongside 8.0 and 9.0
- All `Microsoft.Extensions.*` and related packages updated to their latest stable versions for each target
- A BenchmarkDotNet baseline suite covering CRUD, pagination, and filter operations across all three runtimes
- A supported-frameworks table in the README and docs with a defined deprecation schedule

**Benefits**
- Teams on .NET 10 can adopt the framework with confidence from day one
- A benchmark baseline that catches performance regressions automatically in CI before they ship
- Clear signaling of which .NET versions are supported and for how long
- Alignment with Microsoft's LTS support windows reduces long-term maintenance burden

---

### Feature 1.5.5 — XML Documentation Completeness

**Title:** Full IntelliSense Coverage for Every Public API

**Intent**  
> "Make every public class, interface, and method self-describing in the IDE, so developers spend less time reading source code and more time building features."

**The Problem Today**  
`EntityManager<TEntity>` and `EntityManager<TEntity, TKey>` — the most commonly used types across most consumer applications — have incomplete `<summary>`, `<param>`, and `<returns>` tags on many methods. Developers relying on IDE tooltips encounter blank descriptions, which increases the time-to-productivity cost for both new contributors and adopters.

**What We Are Building**  
- Complete XML documentation on every public API across the Manager, Core, and driver packages
- A CI check that fails the build on any public member without a `<summary>` tag
- Usage `<example>` blocks added to the ten most-used APIs
- Updated documentation reflecting the v1.5 API surface

**Benefits**
- Rich, always-accurate IntelliSense across all packages out of the box
- Lower barrier to entry for new contributors and library adopters
- Reduced reliance on reading source code for basic usage questions
- Improved long-term maintainability score

---

## Milestone 2: v1.6.0 — "Developer Flow"

**Release Target:** Q3 2026  
**Theme:** Unified setup, executable queries, seamless DI

Today, wiring up Deveel Repository requires knowing the specific setup pattern for each driver, composing multiple `AddRepository*` calls correctly, and discovering which interfaces a repository exposes through trial and error. The `QueryBuilder<TEntity>` composes a query but does not execute it — there is always a boilerplate bridging step. v1.6.0 collapses that friction into a single discoverable setup API and closes the gap between composing a query and running it.

---

### Feature 1.6.1 — Unified Repository Setup Builder

**Title:** Fluent, Driver-Agnostic Repository Registration for `IServiceCollection`

**Intent**  
> "Let developers configure all repositories — regardless of driver — through one consistent, discoverable DI setup pattern that they only need to learn once."

**The Problem Today**  
Each driver ships its own `AddRepository*` extension overloads with driver-specific parameters. A project using MongoDB as its primary store and In-Memory for test overrides must know two completely different setup APIs, keep them in sync, and mentally map how options flow through each. This discourages multi-driver setups and makes onboarding expensive.

**What We Are Building**  
- A top-level `AddRepositoryContext()` entry point on `IServiceCollection` that returns a fluent `RepositoryContextBuilder`
- Driver-specific `.UseMongoDB(...)`, `.UseEntityFramework(...)`, `.UseInMemory(...)` extensions that chain off that builder
- Cross-cutting configuration — caching, validation, multi-tenancy, logging — registered once on the context builder and automatically applied to all repositories
- Assembly-scanning auto-discovery of repository implementations, removing the need to list each concrete type manually

**Benefits**
- A single learnable setup pattern regardless of which driver a project uses
- Cross-cutting infrastructure (caching, validation) configured in one place instead of duplicated per repository
- Shorter, more readable `Program.cs` / `Startup.cs`
- Easier driver switching (e.g. In-Memory in tests, MongoDB in production) through environment-conditional configuration

---

### Feature 1.6.2 — QueryBuilder Execution Extensions

**Title:** Repository-Bound Execution Methods on `QueryBuilder<TEntity>`

**Intent**  
> "Close the gap between composing a query and running it — queries built with `QueryBuilder` should execute directly against a repository without additional bridging code."

**The Problem Today**  
`QueryBuilder<TEntity>` provides fluent filter and ordering composition but stops short of execution: calling code must unwrap the built `IQuery`, pass it to `IFilterableRepository.FindAsync` or `IPageableRepository.GetPageAsync`, and handle the types separately. This imposes a two-API mental model — build here, run over there — and forces consumers to write boilerplate connecting the two sides.

**What We Are Building**  
- Execution extension methods on `QueryBuilder<TEntity>` accepting a repository parameter and returning the appropriate result type (`Task<TEntity?>`, `IAsyncEnumerable<TEntity>`, `Task<PageResult<TEntity>>`)
- Factory extensions directly on `IFilterableRepository` and `IPageableRepository` for starting a bound fluent chain: `repository.Query().Where(...).OrderBy(...).GetPage(1, 20)`
- Backward-compatible with all existing `IQuery` and `PageQuery<TEntity>` usages — no existing code needs to change

**Benefits**
- A single API mental model: compose and execute a query in one fluent chain
- Reduces per-query boilerplate in application and service code
- IDE auto-complete makes all query capabilities discoverable starting from the repository reference
- Establishes a pluggable execution hook exploitable by future caching and tracing layering

---

### Feature 1.6.3 — Pluggable Cache Provider Abstraction

**Title:** Decouple Entity Caching from the EasyCaching Library

**Intent**  
> "Allow teams to plug in any caching infrastructure they already own — in-process, Redis, or custom — without adding EasyCaching as an extra dependency."

**The Problem Today**  
`EntityManager` caching is wired exclusively to EasyCaching via `Deveel.Repository.Manager.EasyCaching`. Teams using StackExchange.Redis directly, `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory`, or a corporate distributed cache cannot use the entity caching pipeline without pulling in EasyCaching as an intermediate layer — a dependency they did not choose and do not want.

**What We Are Building**  
- A formalized, stable `IEntityCache<TEntity>` contract (the interface exists today but is underspecified)
- A default in-process adapter using `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory` requiring no extra packages
- An optional `IDistributedCache`-based Redis adapter as a separate package
- The EasyCaching adapter retained as an optional package for consumers already invested in it
- Documentation of the caching contract so any third-party strategy can be plugged in

**Benefits**
- Teams bring their existing caching infrastructure without adopting a new library
- Reduced dependency graph for projects that only need simple in-process caching
- The distributed Redis adapter enables correct caching semantics in multi-instance deployments
- Swapping cache providers requires only a DI configuration change — no application code changes

---

### Feature 1.6.4 — Automatic Timestamp and Ownership Management

**Title:** Auto-Populate `IHaveTimeStamp` and `IHaveOwner` Properties on Create and Update

**Intent**  
> "Let entities declare their timestamp and ownership fields and have the framework populate them automatically — no manual `entity.CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow` in consumer code, ever."

**The Problem Today**  
`IHaveTimeStamp` and `IHaveOwner<TKey>` are defined in Core as marker interfaces but carry no automation. Consumers must either remember to set `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`, and `Owner` before calling the repository, or add a custom pre-save hook in every project. This is repetitive, easy to forget, and leads to inconsistent audit data across different code paths.

**What We Are Building**  
- Detection of `IHaveTimeStamp` on entities entering `AddAsync` and `UpdateAsync` in `EntityManager`
- Automatic assignment of `CreatedAt` on first persistence using an injected `ISystemTime` service
- Automatic refresh of `UpdatedAt` on every subsequent update
- Detection of `IHaveOwner<TKey>` and resolution of the current actor from the `IUserAccessor` service already present in Core
- An opt-out attribute for entities with custom timestamp or ownership logic

**Benefits**
- Zero-boilerplate audit timestamps and ownership — declare the interface, get the behavior
- Server-authoritative timestamps that do not trust client-submitted clock values
- `ISystemTime` injection keeps timestamps deterministic and testable in unit tests
- Reduces the number of cross-cutting concerns teams must wire up manually per entity type

---

## Milestone 3: v1.7.0 — "Entity Lifecycle"

**Release Target:** Q4 2026 (early)  
**Theme:** Soft delete, entity states, domain event emission

Applications are not just about storing data — they care deeply about what *happened* to it. Records get logically retired, workflow statuses transition, and operations somewhere downstream need to react to those changes. v1.7.0 gives the framework its first first-class lifecycle story: transparent soft deletes that protect queries from deleted data, a fully-implemented state machine built on the nascent `States.Core` package, and observable CRUD events that decouple side-effects from the repository layer.

---

### Feature 1.7.1 — Soft Delete Support

**Title:** Transparent Soft-Delete Filtering Across All Drivers

**Intent**  
> "Enable teams to retire records without physical deletion — and never worry about accidentally surfacing deleted data in normal application queries."

**The Problem Today**  
Regulatory, operational, and undo requirements push many teams toward logical deletion. Today this is entirely DIY: add a flag column, filter it manually in every query, and hope no new query path forgets the filter. The `IRepository.RemoveAsync` path has no hook to intercept and rewrite this as a soft delete; there is no convention at all.

**What We Are Building**  
- An `ISoftDeletable` marker interface carrying `DeletedAt` and `DeletedBy` properties
- Automatic rewriting of `RemoveAsync` into a soft-delete update when the entity implements `ISoftDeletable`
- A global query filter — applied at the driver level for EF Core and MongoDB — that transparently excludes soft-deleted records from all regular queries
- `IncludeDeleted()` and `OnlyDeleted()` query modifiers for administrative, reporting, or recovery contexts
- A `RestoreAsync` operation on `EntityManager` for undeleting a record
- Full driver coverage: EF Core global query filter; MongoDB `{DeletedAt: null}` filter; In-Memory inline filter

**Benefits**
- Compliance-ready data retention with zero query-level changes in normal application code
- No risk of accidentally surfacing deleted data in read or write operations
- Self-service data recovery through the strongly-typed `RestoreAsync` API
- Full audit trail of who deleted what and when, stored directly on the entity

---

### Feature 1.7.2 — Entity State Machine

**Title:** First-Class State Transition Management via `States.Core`

**Intent**  
> "Give entities a governed state lifecycle — with declared transitions, transition history, and guard conditions — without making every team implement their own state machine from scratch."

**The Problem Today**  
`Deveel.Repository.States.Core` contains two synchronous extension wrappers and a handful of empty interfaces (`IStateRepository`, `IEntity`, `StateInfo`). It is essentially a stub. Applications modeling workflow states (order status, subscription lifecycle, document approval) must build their own state management atop the raw repository layer, duplicating the same pattern across every project.

**What We Are Building**  
- A complete `IStateRepository<TEntity, TStatus>` backed by EF Core and MongoDB drivers
- A `StateTransition<TStatus>` descriptor declaring allowed states, valid transitions, and guard predicates
- State change history records (who transitioned, from which state, to which state, when) queryable via the repository
- `EntityManager` integration: `TransitionStateAsync` respects the declared transition map and emits pre- and post-transition events
- An opt-in `StateTransitionValidator` that plugs into the existing `IEntityValidator` pipeline to reject invalid transitions before they reach the database

**Benefits**
- Centralized, auditable state lifecycle instead of ad-hoc flag columns
- Invalid transitions are rejected with a well-typed exception before the database is touched
- Complete state history queryable through the repository without custom tables or triggers
- Reusable across any entity type: orders, subscriptions, documents, registrations

---

### Feature 1.7.3 — Domain Event Emission from EntityManager

**Title:** Observable CRUD and State-Change Events from the Manager Layer

**Intent**  
> "Surface every meaningful lifecycle change as an observable event so downstream systems — notifications, search indexers, audit logs — can react without coupling to the repository internals."

**The Problem Today**  
Repository writes are fire-and-forget from the framework's perspective. Teams needing side effects (send a notification when an entity is created, reindex a record on update, log an audit entry on delete) add glue code inside controllers or application services — scattered, untestable, and easy to miss when new code paths are added.

**What We Are Building**  
- A typed `EntityEvent<TEntity>` envelope carrying operation type, entity snapshot, actor, and timestamp
- An `IEntityEventPublisher` interface registered as an optional DI service
- Hook points on `EntityManager` for `OnCreated`, `OnUpdated`, `OnDeleted`, and `OnStateChanged`
- A default MediatR-compatible publisher adapter as a small optional package
- An `IEntityEventHandler<TEntity>` convention-based subscriber for in-process handling

**Benefits**
- Side effects live in dedicated, independently testable handlers — not scattered across service classes
- Foundation for outbox and message-bus adapters targeted in later milestones
- Works with any in-process pub/sub: MediatR, .NET `IObservable`, or a custom implementation
- Every handler receives the same strongly-typed event regardless of which driver triggered it

---

## Milestone 4: v1.8.0 — "Scale & Throughput"

**Release Target:** Q4 2026 (late)  
**Theme:** Bulk operations, async streaming, read/write separation

Single-entity CRUD is not sufficient for serious workloads. Importing a product catalog, streaming an event feed, or running a nightly reconciliation all demand operations that move many entities at once, predictably, without materializing everything in memory. v1.8.0 introduces the throughput primitives that mid-to-large teams need.

---

### Feature 1.8.1 — Batch Operations in EntityManager

**Title:** Validated Bulk Add, Update, and Remove with Partial-Failure Control

**Intent**  
> "Let teams import, sync, or purge hundreds or thousands of entities in one managed operation — with the same validation and event guarantees as single-entity calls, not just raw driver range methods."

**The Problem Today**  
`IRepository.AddRangeAsync` and `RemoveRangeAsync` exist at the driver level but bypass the `EntityManager` entirely: no validation, no cache invalidation, no event emission. Teams needing validated bulk inserts must loop over the single-entity `CreateAsync` on the manager, which is slow and lacks transactional semantics.

**What We Are Building**  
- `CreateManyAsync`, `UpdateManyAsync`, and `DeleteManyAsync` methods on `EntityManager<TEntity, TKey>`
- Validation runs concurrently per entity up to a configurable degree of parallelism
- Partial-failure mode: collect all validation errors before aborting, or abort on first failure
- Transactional mode: wrap the whole batch in a unit of work where the driver supports it
- Progress reporting via `IProgress<BatchOperationProgress>` for long-running import scenarios
- Batch event emission: one aggregated event per batch rather than N individual events

**Benefits**
- Import, sync, and migration workflows use the same single, well-tested code path
- Partial-failure collection eliminates the "fix one error, re-run, discover another" cycle
- Progress reporting enables responsive UIs for long data-import operations
- Consistent validation guarantees whether entities are created one at a time or in large batches

---

### Feature 1.8.2 — Async Streaming Queries

**Title:** `IAsyncEnumerable<TEntity>` Streaming for Large Dataset Traversal

**Intent**  
> "Allow consumers to walk through large collections entity-by-entity without loading everything into memory — so data exports, ETL pipelines, and report generators stay memory-efficient at any scale."

**The Problem Today**  
All current query paths materialize results as `IReadOnlyList<TEntity>` or `PageResult<TEntity>`. Traversing a large collection — all customers for an export, all records for a nightly job — requires either iterating through pages with manual continuation logic or loading the full set at once. Neither approach is memory-efficient; both require repetitive plumbing code.

**What We Are Building**  
- An `IAsyncEnumerableRepository<TEntity>` capability interface with a `FindAllAsync()` returning `IAsyncEnumerable<TEntity>`
- Streaming implementations in each driver: EF Core `AsAsyncEnumerable()`, MongoDB cursor iteration, In-Memory yield-return
- A `.ToStreamAsync(repository)` terminal execution method on `QueryBuilder<TEntity>` for filtered streaming
- Configurable back-pressure and cancellation support throughout the streaming pipeline
- Documentation guidance on when paged queries are preferable vs. streaming

**Benefits**
- Memory-constant traversal of arbitrarily large collections with `await foreach`
- ETL, export, and analytics pipelines can process data as it arrives rather than waiting for full materialization
- Natural integration with the broader .NET streaming ecosystem (channels, Pipelines, etc.)
- Back-pressure support prevents overwhelming downstream consumers in producer/consumer scenarios

---

### Feature 1.8.3 — Read/Write Repository Split

**Title:** Separate `IReadRepository` and `IWriteRepository` Capability Interfaces

**Intent**  
> "Make the distinction between reading and writing explicit in the type system — enabling CQRS-aligned designs, read-replica routing, and tighter security boundaries by construction."

**The Problem Today**  
All current repository interfaces are read-write, even when a consumer only needs read access. A query handler or a report generator has no type-system way to declare "this service should never write." Accidentally introducing a write into a read-only context is invisible to the compiler. CQRS patterns have no natural expression in the current interface hierarchy.

**What We Are Building**  
- `IReadRepository<TEntity, TKey>` covering `FindAsync`, `GetPageAsync`, `FindAllAsync`, `CountAsync`
- `IWriteRepository<TEntity, TKey>` covering `AddAsync`, `UpdateAsync`, `RemoveAsync`, `AddRangeAsync`
- `IRepository<TEntity, TKey>` remains the combined interface extending both — no breaking change
- The EF Core driver optionally routes `IReadRepository` calls to a configured read-replica connection string
- `EntityManager` exposes a `ReadOnly` property returning an `IReadRepository`-scoped facade

**Benefits**
- The type system enforces the read/write boundary that CQRS designs intend — the compiler becomes a design guardian
- Read-replica routing becomes a driver-level concern, transparent to all application code
- Security-minded teams can inject read-only repositories into controllers knowing the compiler prevents accidental writes
- A smaller, sharper interface to implement when building custom read-only repository adapters

---

## Milestone 5: v1.9.0 — "Observability & Governance"

**Release Target:** Q1 2027 (early)  
**Theme:** OpenTelemetry tracing, audit trails, EF Core multi-tenancy parity

Enterprise deployments need to *see* what data is doing: who changed it, which tenant owns it, how long queries take. v1.9.0 wires the framework into the standard .NET observability stack, adds query-accessible audit history, and delivers EF Core multi-tenancy on par with what MongoDB users have had since v1.x.

---

### Feature 1.9.1 — OpenTelemetry Integration

**Title:** Distributed Tracing and Metrics for Every Repository Operation

**Intent**  
> "Make Deveel Repository a first-class citizen in distributed traces — so teams can see data-layer performance, correlate slowdowns with application spans, and alert on repository-level anomalies."

**The Problem Today**  
Repository operations are completely invisible to distributed tracing systems today. A slow query shows up in application metrics only as a slow HTTP response; there is no span distinguishing "EF Core `GetPageAsync` took 450ms" from "business logic took 10ms." Teams running on Kubernetes with Datadog, Grafana, or Azure Monitor have no repository-level drill-down capability.

**What We Are Building**  
- `System.Diagnostics.Activity` spans automatically created around every `IRepository` operation (find, get-page, add, update, remove)
- Standard OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for database spans (`db.system`, `db.name`, sanitized `db.statement`)
- Custom metrics: `repository.query.duration`, `repository.write.duration`, `repository.cache.hit_ratio`
- A `AddRepositoryTelemetry()` extension that wires the framework into the host's `TracerProvider` and `MeterProvider`
- Compatible with any OTLP backend: Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog, Azure Monitor, Grafana LGTM

**Benefits**
- Data-layer performance is visible in every existing distributed tracing dashboard with zero code changes in consumer applications
- Teams can correlate slow HTTP responses with the specific repository operation causing the delay
- Proactive alerting on query latency or cache degradation using standard OTLP metrics
- Telemetry is additive — enabling or disabling it requires only a DI configuration change

---

### Feature 1.9.2 — Audit Trail Support

**Title:** Automatic Change Attribution and Queryable Entity History

**Intent**  
> "Record who changed what data and when — automatically, consistently, and queryably — satisfying compliance requirements without custom audit infrastructure in every consuming project."

**The Problem Today**  
`IHaveTimeStamp` and `IHaveOwner` capture creation metadata but no change history. When an auditor asks "who changed this customer's credit limit last Tuesday?", teams today have no framework answer — they have database-level triggers, manual logging in service code, or simply no audit trail at all.

**What We Are Building**  
- An `IAuditableEntity` marker interface specifying `CreatedBy`, `CreatedAt`, `ModifiedBy`, and `ModifiedAt`
- An audit record model capturing entity key, change type, changed property names with old and new values, actor, and timestamp
- `EntityManager` hooks that write audit records automatically on every create, update, and delete
- An `IAuditRepository<TEntity>` for querying the audit history of a specific entity key or actor
- EF Core implementation via a dedicated audit table; MongoDB implementation via an embedded audit array on the document
- Optional PII masking through field-level redaction rules applied before the audit record is written

**Benefits**
- Compliance with GDPR, SOX, HIPAA, and similar audit requirements without bespoke infrastructure
- The "who changed this?" question answered in a single repository call
- PII masking ensures the audit trail itself is safe to store and surface
- The same `IUserAccessor` already present in Core provides consistent actor attribution across all code paths

---

### Feature 1.9.3 — EF Core Multi-Tenancy Parity

**Title:** Tenant-Isolated EF Core Repositories on Par with MongoDB Multi-Tenancy

**Intent**  
> "Give teams building multi-tenant applications on relational databases the same one-API, zero-leakage tenancy experience that MongoDB users have today."

**The Problem Today**  
`Deveel.Repository.MongoFramework.MultiTenant` provides a robust connection-per-tenant isolation model. The EF Core driver has no equivalent: teams building multi-tenant applications on SQL Server or PostgreSQL must implement tenant filtering manually through EF Core global query filters or per-query predicates — with no repository-level convention, tooling, or isolation guarantees from the framework.

**What We Are Building**  
- An `IEntityFrameworkTenantContext` service that provides the current tenant identifier to the EF Core driver
- Automatic global query filter registration for entities implementing `IHaveOwner<TTenantId>` — no per-query filtering required
- A schema-per-tenant strategy option routing each tenant to a named database schema
- A database-per-tenant strategy option using tenant-specific connection strings, paralleling the MongoDB model
- An integration adapter for `Finbuckle.MultiTenant` (the de-facto .NET multi-tenancy library)

**Benefits**
- SQL-backed multi-tenant applications use the same repository API as single-tenant ones
- Zero cross-tenant data leakage — isolation is enforced at the driver level, not trusted to application code
- Teams already using `Finbuckle.MultiTenant` get native integration without any glue code
- Feature parity with MongoDB multi-tenancy — driver choice no longer dictates multi-tenancy capability

---

## Milestone 6: v2.0.0 — "Unified Platform"

**Release Target:** Q1 2027 (late)  
**Theme:** API modernization, new drivers, strategic breaking changes

v1.5–v1.9 delivered capabilities incrementally and carefully. v2.0 takes the structural actions that backward compatibility prevented earlier: a simplified interface hierarchy, a .NET 9 minimum baseline, new first-party drivers for PostgreSQL and Azure Cosmos DB, and source generators that eliminate repository boilerplate entirely.

---

### Feature 2.0.1 — Minimum .NET 9 Baseline

**Title:** Drop .NET 8 Support and Adopt .NET 9+ Features Throughout the Codebase

**Intent**  
> "Free the codebase from the .NET 8 ceiling so it can fully embrace modern runtime improvements and language features — reducing complexity for maintainers and improving performance for consumers."

**The Problem Today**  
.NET 8 reaches end-of-Microsoft-support in November 2026. Maintaining conditional compilation paths for features available only in .NET 9+ (primary constructors, collection expressions, improved async primitives) adds noise to the codebase and delays adoption of runtime performance improvements. Every new feature must be designed within the .NET 8 constraint.

**What We Are Building**  
- Remove `net8.0` from all target framework monikers; ship `net9.0;net10.0` (with `net11.0` when available)
- Migrate to primary constructors, collection expressions, and `params ReadOnlySpan<T>` where they add clarity or performance
- Update the CI matrix to test only .NET 9 and 10
- Document v1.5.x as the maintained LTS-compatible line for teams still on .NET 8
- Publish a framework compatibility promise: current .NET version plus the previous LTS

**Benefits**
- Simpler codebase with fewer `#if` guards and conditional package version trees
- Access to .NET 9+ performance primitives (improved `IAsyncEnumerable`, frozen collections, better allocators)
- Smaller CI matrix — faster pipelines, less flakiness across matrix dimensions
- Aligned with Microsoft's support model: no obligation to support end-of-life runtimes

### Feature 2.0.2 — Simplified Repository Interface Hierarchy

**Title:** Flatten the Dual-Generic Interface Model into a Single, Composable Set

**Intent**  
> "Eliminate the cognitive overhead of choosing between `IRepository<T>` and `IRepository<T, TKey>` by making one variant canonical with a sensible default, and removing the `object`-key workaround entirely."

**The Problem Today**  
The current design maintains a parallel universe of interfaces — `IRepository<T>` and `IRepository<T, TKey>`, `IFilterableRepository<T>` and `IFilterableRepository<T, TKey>`, and so on. New users face a choice that should not exist. The `object`-key variant is a historical workaround that leaks through into all capability interfaces without providing meaningful type safety.

**What We Are Building**  
- A single canonical `IRepository<TEntity, TKey>` with `string` as the conventional default key type for `IRepository<TEntity>`
- Removal of the `object`-key interface tier; a compatibility shim published as a separate package for the v1.x → v2.x upgrade window
- Capability interfaces simplified to single-generic variants: `IFilterableRepository<TEntity>`, `IPageableRepository<TEntity>`, `IAsyncEnumerableRepository<TEntity>`
- A Roslyn-based migration code-fix that renames old interface references automatically
- Adapter base classes that ease the update of custom repository implementations

**Benefits**
- One mental model instead of two — new developers implement the right interface on the first attempt
- A smaller, more focused interface surface — easier to implement custom repository adapters
- The Roslyn migration aid removes 80% of the upgrade effort for consumer codebases
- The compatibility shim package allows gradual migration without a big-bang rewrite

### Feature 2.0.3 — PostgreSQL Native Driver

**Title:** `Deveel.Repository.PostgreSQL` — A JSONB-Backed Repository Driver

**Intent**  
> "Give the large and growing PostgreSQL community a first-party driver that exploits JSONB storage, native full-text search, and array operators — capabilities the generic EF Core driver cannot express."

**The Problem Today**  
PostgreSQL is the dominant open-source relational database, and many .NET teams choose it for JSONB storage, rich indexing, and built-in full-text search. Using it through the EF Core driver works but leaves its most powerful features unexploited. A dedicated driver can map Deveel Repository filter and query abstractions directly to PostgreSQL's native operators instead of going through LINQ's lowest-common-denominator translation.

**What We Are Building**  
- A `Deveel.Repository.PostgreSQL` package built on Npgsql
- `IRepository<TEntity, TKey>` backed by a JSONB entity column with a typed primary key column
- Native mapping of `IQueryFilter` expressions to PostgreSQL JSONB path operators and index-aware queries
- Built-in full-text search support using `tsvector`/`tsquery` operators, implementing the `IFullTextSearchRepository` contract
- Geospatial query support via PostGIS when the extension is available
- Automatic GIN index creation for JSONB and full-text columns at schema migration time

**Benefits**
- Schema-less entity storage with the ACID guarantees and operational maturity of a relational engine
- Full-text search and geospatial queries without needing a dedicated search cluster
- Teams move from EF Core mappings to PostgreSQL-native features at zero application API change cost
- Npgsql binary protocol and connection-pooling optimizations apply by default

### Feature 2.0.4 — Azure Cosmos DB Driver

**Title:** `Deveel.Repository.CosmosDB` — Cloud-Native Driver for Azure Cosmos DB

**Intent**  
> "Give Azure-native teams a first-party Cosmos DB driver that handles partition key management, change feed processing, and multi-region failover transparently within the repository abstraction."

**The Problem Today**  
Azure Cosmos DB is the leading serverless, globally-distributed document database for Azure workloads. Teams using it today access it through the raw .NET SDK, losing all repository abstraction benefits. Partition key management, continuation tokens, and change feed processing are sharp edges that are well worth encapsulating.

**What We Are Building**  
- A `Deveel.Repository.CosmosDB` package built on the `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` SDK v4
- Automatic partition key resolution from entity properties or a pluggable strategy
- Transparent continuation-token pagination mapped to the framework's `PageResult<TEntity>` API
- Change feed subscription mapped to the `IEntityEventPublisher` interface introduced in v1.7
- Multi-region failover and preferred-region configuration surfaced through driver options
- Both serverless and provisioned throughput modes supported with appropriate configuration guidance

**Benefits**
- Full repository abstraction over Cosmos DB — no raw SDK wiring in application code
- Partition key complexity is hidden behind driver configuration, not leaked into query expressions
- Change feed events feed the same event handlers as every other driver without any extra wiring
- Teams can prototype on In-Memory, validate on Cosmos DB, and switch with a single DI registration change

### Feature 2.0.5 — Repository Source Generators

**Title:** Compile-Time Repository Scaffolding via Roslyn Source Generators

**Intent**  
> "Generate the plumbing code for custom repository classes at compile time, so teams spend zero effort on boilerplate and can focus exclusively on the domain operations unique to their business."

**The Problem Today**  
Creating a custom repository — even a trivial one adding two domain-specific query methods — requires: implementing the right interface combination, wiring DI registration, propagating `CancellationToken` correctly, adding exception wrapping, and threading logging through the constructor. Teams copy-paste patterns from documentation or from each other, and the copies drift over time.

**What We Are Building**  
- A `[Repository]` attribute and Roslyn incremental source generator that emits full repository boilerplate for any class marked with it
- Generated code covers: interface implementation, constructor DI injection, `ILogger` plumbing, `CancellationToken` propagation, and standard `RepositoryException` wrapping
- Opt-in generation of a matching `EntityManager` subclass binding to the generated repository
- A `dotnet new deveel-repository` project template that scaffolds a full domain aggregate (entity, repository, manager, DI wiring) in one command
- Generated code is transparent, visible in IDE navigation, and fully overridable — no hidden magic

**Benefits**
- Custom repositories created in seconds with zero risk of forgetting cancellation, logging, or exception handling
- All generated repositories are idiomatic and consistent — copy-paste drift across a codebase is eliminated
- The `dotnet new` template gives new team members a correct, working starting point in one command
- Generated code is fully auditable, debuggable, and ejectable — developers always remain in control
